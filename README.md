# Docker Remote API wrapper for Haskell

Travis CI : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/denibertovic/docker-hs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/denibertovic/docker-hs)

## Current state

**Not production ready!**

The library is going through a **total rewrite**. Please see the **dev** branch for more details.

## Contributing

I'm currently not accepting features into the master branch as it will make merging the dev branch harder.
If you wish to submit a bug fix then it's fine to file a PR against master, otherwise please
consider helping out with the changes currently being made in the dev branch. Once a new release is out
the door I will start accepting feature PR's again.

Please consider filling an Issue first and discuss design decisions and implementation details before
writing any code. This is so that no development cycles goes to waste on either implementing a feature that
will not be merged either because of implementation details or other reasons.
