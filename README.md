# An API client for docker written in Haskell

| [![master](https://travis-ci.org/denibertovic/docker-hs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/denibertovic/docker-hs) |


## Current state

**API is still not stable.**

Supported Docker Engine Api version: `v1.24`

Anything upward of that should work since Docker versions their API.
Older docker version and engine api versions are not supported at the moment.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute please see any issue tagged with "help wanted".
Make sure to submit your PR's against the `master` branch.

Please consider filling an Issue first and discuss design decisions and implementation details before
writing any code. This is so that no development cycles go to waste on implementing a feature that
might not get merged either because of implementation details or other reasons.
